# NMT-Project
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) project for EECS 595 Course.

## What is NMT (Neural Machine Translation)

## About this Repo
The project is based on the python (3.9.15) and Pytorch (>=2.0.1).

Hugging Face is also used for text tokenization. To use the related function, one has to install the following packages
```
pip install transformers sentencepiece sacremoses evaluate
```
The encoder-decoder architecture is used for machine translation tasks.

Different ML algorithms are tried to achieve a better performance and also for us to understand their differences.
- RNN-based models like LSTM, GRU
- Transformer model
