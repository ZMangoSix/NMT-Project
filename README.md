## What is NMT (Neural Machine Translation)

## About this Repo
The project is based on the python (3.9.15) and pytorch (2.0.1).
The encoder-decoder architecture is used for machine translation task.
Different ML algorithms are tried to achieve a better performance and also for us to understand their differences.
